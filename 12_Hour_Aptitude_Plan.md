### Guiding Principles

*   **Focus on Revision, Not Learning:** Do not try to learn entirely new topics. Stick to strengthening what you already know.
*   **Time-Box Your Practice:** Use a timer for every session. The Pomodoro Technique (50 minutes of focused study + 10-minute break) is built into this schedule.
*   **Prioritize High-Frequency Topics:** The plan focuses on topics that appear most frequently in aptitude tests.
