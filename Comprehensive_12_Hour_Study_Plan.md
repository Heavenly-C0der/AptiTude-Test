# Comprehensive 12-Hour Study Plan (All Subjects)

This is an aggressive, high-speed study plan designed to refresh your knowledge across all key computer science subjects within a 12-hour timeframe. The focus is on rapid revision of the most critical concepts.

---

### Guiding Principles

*   **80/20 Rule:** We will focus on the 20% of topics that will likely cover 80% of what you'll be asked in a generalist interview.
*   **Time-Boxing is Crucial:** Each block is strictly timed. When the time is up, move on. The goal is breadth, not depth.
*   **No New Topics:** This is purely for revision. Do not try to learn a new algorithm or concept from scratch.

### The 12-Hour Integrated Breakdown

**Block 1: DSA & OOP Fundamentals (Hours 1-3)**
*   **Hour 1 (60 min): Core Data Structures.**
    *   **Topics:** Hash Maps, Arrays/Strings, Linked Lists.
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes on each. For Hash Maps, review how they work (collisions). For Arrays/Strings, do 2-3 easy string manipulation problems. For Linked Lists, mentally rehearse reversal and finding the middle element.
*   **Hour 2 (60 min): Core Algorithms & Complexity.**
    *   **Topics:** Big O Notation, Sorting (Merge/Quick Sort), Binary Search.
    *   **Action:** Spend 15 minutes reviewing Big O complexities. Spend 25 minutes on sorting; draw out the steps for Merge Sort on a small array. Spend 20 minutes on Binary Search; write it from scratch once.
*   **Hour 3 (60 min): OOP & Advanced Data Structures.**
    *   **Topics:** The 4 Pillars of OOP, Trees (BST), Graphs (BFS/DFS).
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes explaining the 4 pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) to yourself with simple code examples. Spend 20 minutes on BSTs (insertion/search). Spend 20 minutes on graph traversals (BFS/DFS); draw a simple graph and trace the path for both.

**Block 2: Technical Knowledge - OS & DBMS (Hours 4-5)**
*   **Hour 4 (60 min): Operating Systems Concepts.**
    *   **Topics:** Processes vs. Threads, Mutex vs. Semaphore, Deadlock.
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes on each. Use analogies to solidify your understanding. Explain the difference between a process and a thread out loud. Explain what problem a mutex solves. List the four conditions for deadlock.
*   **Hour 5 (60 min): Database (SQL) Practice.**
    *   **Topics:** `JOIN`s (INNER, LEFT), `GROUP BY`, Subqueries.
    *   **Action:** This hour is purely for practice. Go to LeetCode or HackerRank's database section and solve 3-4 medium-difficulty problems that involve joining tables and aggregating data.

**Block 3: Quantitative & Logical Aptitude (Hours 6-8)**
*   **Hour 6 (60 min): Core Quantitative Aptitude.**
    *   **Topics:** Percentages, Profit & Loss, Time/Speed/Distance.
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes on each topic, focusing on solving 5-7 problems per topic. Use shortcuts.
*   **Hour 7 (60 min): Logical Reasoning.**
    *   **Topics:** Seating Arrangements, Blood Relations, Syllogisms.
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes on each. Draw diagrams. For syllogisms, use Venn diagrams.
*   **Hour 8 (60 min): Verbal Ability & Data Interpretation.**
    *   **Topics:** Reading Comprehension, Sentence Correction, DI Charts.
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes on a reading passage. Spend 20 minutes on grammar rules. Spend 20 minutes interpreting one bar/pie chart.

**Block 4: Machine Learning Core (Hours 9-10)**
*   **Hour 9 (60 min): ML Concepts.**
    *   **Topics:** Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning, Overfitting/Underfitting, Bias-Variance Tradeoff.
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes on each. Explain them conceptually. For overfitting, list 3 ways to combat it. For the Bias-Variance tradeoff, draw the classic graph.
*   **Hour 10 (60 min): ML Algorithms & Evaluation.**
    *   **Topics:** Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Confusion Matrix (Precision/Recall).
    *   **Action:** Spend 20 minutes explaining how Linear and Logistic Regression differ. Spend 20 minutes on Decision Trees. Spend 20 minutes drawing a confusion matrix and calculating Precision, Recall, and F1-score from it.

**Block 5: Final Review & Mock Interview Prep (Hours 11-12)**
*   **Hour 11 (60 min): Project & Resume Review.**
    *   **Action:** Read through your resume. For each project, prepare a 2-minute summary. Be ready to answer: "What was the biggest challenge?" and "What would you do differently?"
*   **Hour 12 (60 min): Final Polish & Rest.**
    *   **Action:** Quickly review the most important formulas or concepts from your notes (max 30 minutes). Then, stop. Relax. A calm mind is your biggest asset.

### Final Advice

*   **Be Realistic:** You cannot master everything in 12 hours. The goal is to be confident in the fundamentals of each topic.
*   **Verbalize Concepts:** Explaining concepts out loud is a powerful way to check your understanding and prepare for an interview setting.
*   **Prioritize Sleep:** The last hour is for rest. Do not skip it. A tired brain makes simple mistakes.

Good luck!
